        <h3>IoT Design</h3>
        <p class="skill-2-para">Iot is the trend nowadays and being a mechatronics engineer means that it is my trade. I am proficient in Iot design using the Arduino and ESP platforms,
           to find smart solutions. Having worked on multiple Iot projects gives me the know-how on tackling real life problems.</p>
